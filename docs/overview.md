Based on the Thorough Analysis of the inspector tool.


- The *inspector* is a command-line tool intended for analyzing and understanding design files utilized in printing and cutting shops. It ensures that these files fulfil certain criteria, before they can proceed for printing and cutting operations.
- The main features of *inspector* include:
  - **Supported Formats**: The ability to understand various image file formats. The image formats supported are to be mentioned in the configuration file.
  - **Font Recognition**: It utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize fonts used within the designs. Inspector identifies the fonts used within the graphic designs, and flags any odd ones out.
  - **Color Spaces & Spot Colors**: Inspector is capable of identifying the different color spaces used within the graphic files, and recognizes spot colors within those files. The identification of a color space is vital to uphold the color integrity of the original design during the print process.
  - **Layer Identification**: *inspector* can identify different layers within a graphic file. This could be particularly useful in understanding complex designs that have elements distributed across different layers.


From a structural viewpoint, the critical components of the project are:
- `inspector.py`: The central script that provides the command-line interface (CLI).
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the project dependencies.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project, which includes installation and usage instructions.
- `src/config/: A directory for storing configuration files. It contains a JSON file(`config.json`) meant for configuring *inspector* behavior.
- `src/`: The directory for the source code.
- `tests/`: A directory meant for storing unit tests.


The critical dependencies required for this project are:
- Pillow for processing image.
- pytesseract for OCR (font recognition).
- 

In conclusion, we have established a comprehensive understanding of the *inspector* tool. Our next step should be examining the source code, starting from the `src` directory, to comprehend the underlying functions and classes that support these features. Additionally, we should review the `config.json` contained within the `src/config/ directory to understand the default configurations for this project.


Before getting our hands dirty with live coding, we must have a complete overview of the tools and libraries used, and how they are leveraged within the script. This analysis will allow us to get a comprehensive overview of the entire system and its behavior.


The understanding will allow us to modify, enhance, or fix any part of the project as required. And with a firm grasp of the *inspector*, we can also update relevant documentation - the *readme* and files within the *docs* directory, after every modification we apply to the code.


## Extending the Inspector Tool
If you're looking to extend the functionalities of the Inspector tool, you can add new Python modules under the `src/` directory. For each new module, you should also consider adding appropriate configuration files within `src/config/`. This will enable seamless integration of the new functionalities.
